Problem 2 Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to
self-report techniques for studying physical activity in observational
studies and clinical trials, largely because of their relative
objectivity. During observation periods, the devices measure “activity
counts” in a short period; one-minute intervals are common. Because
accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce
around-the-clock observations.

This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). The data can be downloaded here. In this
spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for each
minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel_data = read_csv("data/accel_data.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
   pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to="activity",
    values_to="data",
    names_prefix="activity_")%>%
  mutate(
    day_type= recode(day,"Monday"="weekday", "Tuesday"="weekday",  "Wednesday"="weekday", "Thursday"="weekday", "Friday"="weekday", "Saturday"="weekend", "Sunday"="weekend"))
```

    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day

\##Describe resulting dataset \##Need to do this

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_data=read_csv("data/accel_data.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
   pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to="activity",
    values_to="data",
    names_prefix="activity_")%>%
  mutate(
    day_type= recode(day,"Monday"="weekday", "Tuesday"="weekday",  "Wednesday"="weekday", "Thursday"="weekday", "Friday"="weekday", "Saturday"="weekend", "Sunday"="weekend"))%>%
  group_by(day)%>%
  summarize(sum(data))
```

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day

``` r
accel_data%>%knitr::kable(digit=2)
```

| Friday    |   2291711 |
| Monday    |   1858699 |
| Saturday  |   1369237 |

\##Add trends

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accel_data2=read_csv("data/accel_data.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
   pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to="activity",
    values_to="data",
    names_prefix="activity_")%>%
  mutate(
    day_type= recode(day,"Monday"="weekday", "Tuesday"="weekday",  "Wednesday"="weekday", "Thursday"="weekday", "Friday"="weekday", "Saturday"="weekend", "Sunday"="weekend"))%>%
  group_by(day)
```
